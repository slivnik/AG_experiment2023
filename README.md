Supplemental data for the paper **The Impact of Code Bloat on Genetic Program Comprehension:
Replication of a Controlled Experiment on Semantic Inference** by Tomaž Kosar, Željko Kovačević, Marjan Mernik and Boštjan Slivnik.

This paper refers to an earlier experiment described in the paper **On Comprehension of Genetic Programming Solutions: A Controlled Experiment on Semantic Inference** by Boštjan Slivnik, Željko Kovačević, Marjan Mernik and Tomaž Kosar ([Mathematics **2022**, 10, 3386](https://doi.org/10.3390/math10183386)) with the suplemental data available in another [GitHub repository](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiement2022) (commit cf47740).

The replicated experiment consisted of

- the [test](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiment2023/blob/main/AG%20Comprehension%20Test4.pdf) containing 7 tasks and
- the [background and feedback questionnaires](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiment2023/blob/main/AG%20Comprehension%20replication%20background%20%26%20feedback%20questionnaire.pdf).

The results from the replicated study have been compared to the results (on the second test (Group I and Group II) from the original study. Between-subjects design and the relation between studies is depicted in the following table:

The results
- of the [test](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiment2023/blob/main/AG_Comprehension_2023_correctness.pdf) are available in [AG_Comprehension_2023_correctness.xlsx](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiment2023/blob/main/AG_Comprehension_2023_correctness.xlsx);
- of the [background and feedback questionnaires](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiment2023/blob/main/AG_Comprehension_2023_Background_Feedback.pdf) are available in [AG_Comprehension_2023_Background_Feedback.xlsx](https://github.com/slivnik/AG_experiment2023/blob/main/AG_Comprehension_2023_Background_Feedback.xlsx).
